# Torn Apart Public Data

This is the open data repository for [Torn Apart/Separados](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/)

All of the data gathered for *Torn Apart/Separados* comes via public data repositories and archives. The labor of performing proper search, refine, distil, re-order, display on the data was done by the volunteers work of the team for volume 1 and 2. We are happy to release this curated data back into the public for future works.
